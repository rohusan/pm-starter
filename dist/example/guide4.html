<p>The undo and redo values that the previous example bound to keys are a special kind of functions called commands. Most editing actions are written as commands which can be bound to keys, hooked up to menus, or otherwise exposed to the user.</p>

<p>The prosemirror-commands package provides a number of basic editing commands, along with a minimal keymap that you'll probably want to enable to have things like enter and delete do the expected thing in your editor.</p>

<pre>
// (Omitted repeated imports)
import {baseKeymap} from "prosemirror-commands"

let dom = document.getElementById('jsEditor')
let state = EditorState.create({
  schema,
  plugins: [
    history(),
    keymap({"Mod-z": undo, "Mod-y": redo, "Mod-shift-z": redo}),
    keymap(baseKeymap)
  ]
})
let view = new EditorView(dom, {state})
</pre>

<p>At this point, you have a basically working editor.</p>

<p>To add a menu, additional keybindings for schema-specific things, and so on, you might want to look into the prosemirror-example-setup package. This is a module that provides you with an array of plugins that set up a baseline editor, but as the name suggests, it is meant more as an example than as a production-level library. For a real-world deployment, you'll probably want to replace it with custom code that sets things up exactly the way you want.</p>

<p class="szQuestion">Spaces don't work as expected: use whitespace pre-wrap!</p>
