<p>When the user types, or otherwise interacts with the view, it generates ‘state transactions’. What that means is that it does not just modify the document in-place and implicitly update its state in that way. Instead, every change causes a transaction to be created, which describes the changes that are made to the state, and can be applied to create a new state, which is then used to update the view.</p>

<p>By default this all happens under the cover, but you can hook into by writing plugins or configuring your view. For example, this code adds a dispatchTransaction prop, which will be called whenever a transaction is created:</p>

<pre>
// (Imports omitted)

let dom = document.getElementById('jsEditor')
let state = EditorState.create({schema})
let view = new EditorView(dom, {
  state,
  dispatchTransaction(transaction) {
    console.log("Document size went from", transaction.before.content.size,
                "to", transaction.doc.content.size)
    let newState = view.state.apply(transaction)
    view.updateState(newState)
  }
})
</pre>

<p>Every state update has to go through updateState, and every normal editing update will happen by dispatching a transaction.</p>
